There are two mixins that will contribute to this interface:

* xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/bookmark/BookmarkHolder_lookup.adoc[BookmarkHolder_lookup]
+
which contributes a `lookup` action to return the referenced object

* xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/bookmark/BookmarkHolder_object.adoc[BookmarkHolder_object]
+
which contributes instead an `object` property, being the referenced object.

Either of these can be suppressed, if required, using a vetoing subscriber that listens to the action or property domain event in order to hide the member.
