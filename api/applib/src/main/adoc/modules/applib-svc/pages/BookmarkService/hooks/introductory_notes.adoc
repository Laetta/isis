For example, a `Customer` object with an xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#objectType[object type] of "custmgmt.Customer" and an id of 123
would correspond to a xref:BookmarkService.adoc#bookmark[`Bookmark`] with a string representation of "custmgmt.Customer|123".

Bookmarks are useful to store a reference to an arbitrary object, although be aware that there is no referential integrity.

Several of the extension libraries use bookmarks.
For example the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`] uses bookmarks to identify the object that is being modified.

Serialized form of bookmarks also appear within  xref:refguide:schema:about.adoc[schema] instances, for example as used by xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandServiceInternal.adoc[`CommandService`] and the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`PublisherService`].
