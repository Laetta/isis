// TODO - v2 to reconcile with .java (or maybe just delete)

//<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc#name[`name()`]
//+
//Names a group of (property) pathsToInclude.
//All properties with this name will be grouped together.
//
//<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc#sequence[`sequence()`]
//+
//Defines an ordering for pathsToInclude, within their container.

As this is an important topic, there is xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[chapter] in the user guide that discusses object layout in full.


[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`]) and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`] that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
 This is specifically so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
